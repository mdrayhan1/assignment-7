          What is the difference between local storage and session storage?

            SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
            while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
            cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in
            a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
            and assigned to that particular tab.
