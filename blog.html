          What is the difference between local storage and session storage?
        </div>
        <div class="accordian-item-body">
          <div class="accordian-item-body-content">
            SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
            while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
            cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in
            a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
            and assigned to that particular tab.

      <!-- second question and answer -->
      <div class="accordian-item">
        <div class="accordian-item-header">
          What is the difference between global scope and block scope?
        </div>
        <div class="accordian-item-body">
          <div class="accordian-item-body-content">
            In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the
            window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global
            object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements,
            for statements, and the like.

        <div class="accordian-item-header">
          How JavaScript's Event Loop Works?
        </div>
        <div class="accordian-item-body">
          <div class="accordian-item-body-content">
            The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and
            the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
            take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick
            in the Event Loop.

            <!-- fourth number question and answer -->
      <div class="accordian-item">
        <div class="accordian-item-header">
          When will undefined appear in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="accordian-item-body">
          <div class="accordian-item-body-content">
            In JavaScript if a variable has been declared, but has not been
            assigned a value, is automatically assigned the value undefined .
            Therefore, if you try to display the value of such variable, the
            word "undefined" will be displayed.
