            SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
            while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
            cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in
            a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
            and assigned to that particular tab.

          What is the difference between global scope and block scope?
        </div>
        <div class="accordian-item-body">
          <div class="accordian-item-body-content">
            In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the
            window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global
            object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements,
            for statements, and the like.
